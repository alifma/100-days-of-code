# 100 Days of Code

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the 100 Days of Code challenge that I started on [start date]. The goal of this challenge is to make consistent progress in coding with a focus on JavaScript, but also including HTML, CSS, Go, Docker, and Python.

## Repository Structure
Each day's work is stored in its respective folder named `DayXXX` where `XXX` is the day number. This makes it easy to track progress and review previous work.

### Daily Commit Prefix
To organize commits and understand their purpose at a glance, the following prefixes are used:
- **[INIT]** - Initial setup of files and configurations.
- **[ADD]** - Addition of new features or content.
- **[FIX]** - Bug fixes or corrections.
- **[UPDATE]** - Updates to existing features or improvements.
- **[STYLE]** - Stylistic changes, not affecting the functionality.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Each folder contains the projects or tasks for that day. Navigate into the folder of the day you're interested in.
3. Follow the instructions in each folder's README for setup and running the projects.

## Goals
- **Improve proficiency in JavaScript**: Main focus on JavaScript projects, diving into both frontend and backend aspects.
- **Explore new technologies**: Each week, tackle a different technology or framework, integrating it with JavaScript where possible.
- **Build a portfolio of projects**: Develop a variety of small projects that can be showcased to potential employers or collaborators.
- **Learn best practices**: Focus on writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

## Progress
Here's a brief overview of the focus areas covered each week:

- **Week 1-2**: HTML & CSS - Building responsive layouts and foundational web design.
- **Week 3-4**: JavaScript Basics and DOM Manipulation.
- **Week 5**: Introduction to React.js or another JS framework.
- **Week 6**: Golang basics and building simple APIs.
- **Week 7**: Containerization with Docker.
- **Week 8**: Full-stack application development.
- **Week 9**: Data manipulation and automation with Python.
- **Week 10**: Advanced JavaScript and project optimizations.
